# Covid-19 in USA (2020)

## Description

This project uses web map applications to display Covid-19 cases and rates across the United States in 2002. The first map shows the rates of Covid-19 per 100k people through a choropleth map. The second map visualizes Covid-19 cases using a proporitional symbols map.

- [Map 1: Covid-19 Rates](map1.html)
    - Hovering over a state will display information about the county as well as the case count.
    - The darker the color, the higher the rates of Covid-19 per 100k people.
- [Map 2: Covid-19 Cases](map2.html)
    - Clicking on a circle will display the number of cases in that region.
    - The bigger the circle, the more cases of Covid-19 were reported.
